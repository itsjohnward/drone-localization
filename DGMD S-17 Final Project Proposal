Project Title: Monocular drone (Tello) localization
Group Member: John Ward, Yangsoo Song, Daniel Lebedinsky
Type of Project: Hardware
Summary: Given an arbitrary launch point, the drone should be able to determine its position and orientation in a known room.
Level: Graduate

Introduction: 2 paragraphs describing your project and any relevant context

Background: provide the necessary background one might need (assume your audience is me and things on the syllabus I know) (2 paragraphs)

Literature Review (5 sources): find five sources on your topic and summarize them (a paragraph each) (provide embedded links like this) (make them a list)



Methodology:
Connect to the Tello API and issue commands
Get access to the Telloâ€™s camera feed
Identify a marker in a camera feed (i.e. a red dot of known size)
Determine distance from the marker using known camera properties and marker size
Observe multiple markers and determine position and orientation in room
(stretch) use object localization (YOLO) to identify interest points in the room
(stretch) determine object-specific distances https://khandewalshivam.medium.com/distance-estimation-of-various-objects-present-in-an-image-from-camera-when-they-were-captured-64453847a3a1
(stretch) implement ORB-SLAM
